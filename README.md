# Application Runtime

This repository is meant to contain all of the open-source projects under the
remit of the Application Runtime team (for now).

Currently most of them are under the [daml] repository. They will be moved here
over time. We may revisit how these things are organized later down the line;
the main purpose of moving things from [daml] to here is to break projects off
from the Bazel monobuild.
